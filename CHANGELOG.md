## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Configurable installed `DataRoot` shared by Python and ResolveBridge, verified
  legacy-data migration, compatibility junctions and a 10 GiB output reserve.
- Live storage migration of 1440 files (8.369 GiB) to drive G with per-file
  SHA-256 verification, a fresh bridge heartbeat and successful CLI ping.
- M54 fixed-policy bounded video/audio candidate analysis with deterministic
  technical ranking, redacted source paths and explicit limitations.
- M54.2 segment-level candidate analysis with explicit source ranges up to 300
  seconds, including multiple candidate ranges from one allowlisted file.
- M54.2 live same-file segment smoke on drive G with 7/7 video samples,
  bounded audio, deterministic replay and source-path redaction.
- M54.3 script-aware dialogue take ranking with bounded local transcription,
  reference-text fingerprinting and mandatory human review.
- M54.3 path-redacted request index that returns exact persisted replays without
  rerunning CPU transcription.
- M54.4 immutable approved take sequences with canonical selection/review
  integrity, ordered path-redacted handoff and no timeline write.
- M55.1 allowlisted approved-sequence source binding with exact file identity,
  redacted public receipts and private machine-local paths.
- M55.2 deterministic path-redacted assembly preview with revalidated bound
  sources, local video metadata, sequential source/output ranges and mixed
  FPS/resolution warnings; no Resolve or timeline write is performed.
- M55.3 live timeline frame-mapping preview using the existing documented
  editing-metadata readback, deterministic source-frame bounds and contiguous
  target positions without import or timeline mutation.
- Timeline-only `get_editing_metadata` discovery with zero requested assets,
  retaining bounded FPS, resolution and track metadata.
- M55.4 conservative Media Pool import preview with source-fingerprint
  deduplication, deterministic live snapshot binding and mandatory review for
  ambiguous same-name items; no media import is executed.
- M55.5 explicitly confirmed, backup-backed Media Pool import with exact-plan
  validation, private path resolution, canonical metadata/readback checks and
  durable path-redacted replay receipts; timelines remain unchanged.
- M54 immutable approve/reject review records that never modify Resolve.
- M54 live bounded analysis of the two allowlisted synchronized MKV sources,
  including deterministic replay and source-path redaction; human review remains
  pending because the files are complementary camera/screen sources, not takes.
- M53 immutable `tutorial-clean-v1` CDL preset catalogue and schemas with no
  caller-supplied grade values, node indexes, LUT/DRX paths or expressions.
- M53 read-only Resolve color-environment discovery and M52-bound deterministic
  color-treatment preview; grade application remains gated on live Free proof.
- M53 confirmed duplicate-timeline color application with a managed local
  version, code-owned node-1 CDL, canonical target/version readback and replay.
- M53 duplicate-item remapping by exact media identity after live Resolve
  evidence confirmed TimelineItem IDs change when a timeline is duplicated.

  `accent-card-v1` Fusion Title with reproducible SHA-256 verification.
- M52 read-only environment/preview tools and confirmed duplicate-timeline
  application with completed-M51 binding, exact plan/receipt replay, project
  backup, append-only insertion and canonical Fusion-item readback.
- Repeatable Windows install, verification and conservative uninstall of the
  managed Resolve title template while preserving a pre-existing user asset.
- Exact-end and playhead-readback guards for Fusion-title insertion after live
  Resolve evidence showed that an out-of-range playhead can clamp to timeline
  start and ripple existing tracks.
- One bounded Resolve-provider retry only when the bridge confirms a transient
  playhead-readback failure occurred before Fusion-title insertion.
- Correct Fusion Transform center keyframes after visual acceptance showed the
  parsed title and Inspector controls but kept the card outside the frame.
- Replace unsuccessful Key Stretcher variants with Blackmagic's recommended
  mirrored Anim Curves wiring on `Dissolve.Mix`; frame-by-frame acceptance
  evidence showed both earlier variants remained fully static.

  title, editable Inspector fields, unchanged M51 source and exact replay with
  stable backup and timeline counts.

  cleaned audio plus optional M47 subtitles and M49 visual treatment to one
  exact timeline.

  read-only `get_baseline_render_status` with live identity/bounds checks,
  deterministic output naming and durable replay through M44/M45.
- Explicit blocking of mixed disposable/final timeline receipts before any
  render preparation or project backup.
- M50 live acceptance in Resolve 21.0.3 Free with 6/6 core QA, one completed
  managed 1080p job, validated MP4 output and exact replay without a new job.
- Correct M50 completion aggregation against the canonical M45
  `output.validation.passed` result.
- M49 `resolve_insert_title` over documented standard-title insertion with
  exact timecode, explicit confirmation, project backup, playhead restoration,

  undocumented title-text mutation, Fusion controls, keyframes and tracking.
- Generated-item timeline readback with explicit `source_type` and nullable
  source bounds, preventing inserted standard titles from breaking discovery
  while retaining strict source bounds for Media Pool clips.

  testing showed that occupied placement can split existing Resolve items.
